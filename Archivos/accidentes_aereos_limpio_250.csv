Debris was spread across a 20 mile radius. Fifty-two children on a beach holiday were among the 69 aboard the Tupolev. The Tupolev pilot received contradictory instructions. The collision avoidance warning system (TCAS) told the pilot to ascend followed by an order from the Swiss air traffic controller to descend one second later. The Russian plane did not immediately respond to the tower's order to descend, so he repeated the command 14 seconds later. Thirty seconds later the two planes collided. The Tupolev's TCAS was telling the pilots to ascend. The Boeing's TCAS was telling the pilots to descend. The Swiss air traffic controller was telling the Tupolev's pilots to descend. The air traffic controller that guided the planes had no way of knowing the Russian pilot was receiving contradictory instruction from his cockpit TCAS unless told so by the pilot. Russian aviation officials said the pilot correctly gave precedence to the control tower, but Western aviation experts said pilots are trained to give precedence to the cockpit warning. In addition, the controller was left alone on duty while his partner went on a break and was preoccupied with another aircraft. This was accepted policy at Skyguide, the Swiss air control company. In addition, maintenance crews, working on the computer system, limited the controller's information he was receiving including conflict alert warnings.

The aircraft was dispatched with the No. 3 generator inoperative. While this was allowed, United was required to repair the generator at the first airport where there were repair facilities. The aircraft flew for a total of 41 hours with the inoperative generator passing through airports that had the facilities to repair the generator. Soon after taking off, the crew reported a fire warning in the No. 1 engine and shut it down as required. For reasons that could not be determined, shutting down the No. 1 engine and it’s generator tripped the No.2 generator resulting in the loss of all electrical power in the aircraft. Following loss of all electrical power, the battery standby electrical system either was not activated or failed to function. Electrical power at a voltage level of approximately 50 volts was restored approximately a minute and a half after loss of the No. 2 generator. The duration of this power restoration was just 9 to 15 seconds. Regardless, the pilots did not have functioning attitude indicators from the time the No. 2 generator tripped. In the dark, with no outside or inside reference to guide them, the pilots became spatially disoriented and the plane eventually went into a dive and crashed into the Pacific Ocean 11.3 miles west of the airport and sank in 950 ft. of water. The accident was caused by the loss of attitude orientation during a night, instrument departure in which all attitude instruments were disabled by loss of electrical power. The investigation was not able to determine (a) why all generator power was lost or (b) why the standby electrical power system either was not activated or failed to function."" One unproven scenario that is not contradicted by available evidence was the inadvertent placement of the battery switch to the ""OFF"" position by the flight engineer during attempts to remove galley loads from the generator buses. The galley switches were similar in shape and size, and were located on the flight engineer's upper panel in close proximity to the battery switch.

Multiple engine failures occurred as a result of flight in extreme icing conditions. Incomplete performance of the emergency drills by the crew, as a result of not referring to the Emergency Checklist, prejudiced the chances of successful engine re-starts. Crew actions for securing and re-starting the failed engines, which were not in accordance with the operator's procedures, limited the power available. The drag from two unfeathered propellers of the failed engines and the weight of the heavily iced airframe resulted in a loss of height and control before the chosen diversion airfield could be reached. Poor Crew Resource Management reduced the potential for emergency planning, decision making and workload sharing. Consequently, the crew had no contingency plan for the avoidance of the forecast severe icing conditions, and also was unaware of the relative position of a closer diversion airfield which could have been chosen by making more effective use of air traffic services.",1994
